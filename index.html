  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>
    Progressive Enhancement to me means a strong focus on the content first, then caring for the CSS and Javascript. The content is what’s really important, of course, and should be the priority vs focusing on the type of browser or capabilities the user can run. These are important too, but they are more easily adapted and affected with CSS and Javascript you add on later. This is a good mindset because it prioritizes all users being able to access and view the content. Good html should be able to be readable to some degree and usable for all viewers. Then being able to focus on the presentation with CSS and Javascript later on for those who’re able to access it. Having the content be the main goal is good because regardless of the style, people are accessing a web page for some form of content. This mindset will help keep the internet free to access and use for everyone, not just those who have the latest tech. This article 
    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">What is Progressive Enhancement, and why it matters</a>
    brought up a few good points. It talked about how web fonts are a great thing that really help a page look better, but for long pages it can cause problems for people with slow internet. Something I hadn’t even thought about. How you should put your loaded fonts into the CSS document so that they’ll only apply if CSS can load properly. It also brought up the point of using feature checks. How it’s relatively easy to use third party libraries to check browser capabilities before telling the java script to do it.
