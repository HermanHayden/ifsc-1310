  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>
    Progressive Enhancement to me means a strong focus on the content first, then caring for the CSS and Javascript. The content is what’s really important, of course, and should be the priority vs focusing on the type of browser or capabilities the user can run. These are important too, but they are more easily adapted and affected with CSS and Javascript you add on later. This is a good mindset because it prioritizes all users being able to access and view the content. Good html should be able to be readable to some degree and usable for all viewers. Then being able to focus on the presentation with CSS and Javascript later on for those who’re able to access it. Having the content be the main goal is good because regardless of the style, people are accessing a web page for some form of content. This mindset will help keep the internet free to access and use for everyone, not just those who have the latest tech. This article 
    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">What is Progressive Enhancement, and why it matters</a>
    brought up a few good points. It talked about how web fonts are a great thing that really help a page look better, but for long pages it can cause problems for people with slow internet. Something I hadn’t even thought about. How you should put your loaded fonts into the CSS document so that they’ll only apply if CSS can load properly. It also brought up the point of using feature checks. How it’s relatively easy to use third party libraries to check browser capabilities before telling the java script to do it.

  <h2>General / SpaceX Reflection</h2>
  <p>I came into Web Tech not expecting much, but it was really fun. Learning how to set up a html page and formats. Learning the unique things like id, classes, the different inline elements to change up how text looks. Getting to put everything in divs and different formats that could be collapsed was really nice. CSS was fun, but probably my weakest point. I’m not a very creative person design wise, so coming up with unique designs was challenging. It was cool using things like flex and position to change up elements and really give your pages spice. It’s something I’d like to learn a lot more of in the future. I didn’t learn much in Javascript, but that was mostly due to time. Learning the basic format was useful though. When searching up different premade Javascript to learn it was useful knowing the format and it not looking like a complete mess. One of the best learning experiences was the positioning lab. I wasn’t super aware of how positioning worked so the first ten or so minutes were very rough. I kept trying things that just wouldn’t work. Though not helping and making us just test around with what we learned until I got it was really nice. Once it clicked it both felt very good and changed the way I rationally went about thinking of future problems / formats. </p>
  <p>Things I’d say I did well on was formatting html and actually implementing CSS designs once I knew what I wanted. Once I had an idea of the design it was fun and a good challenge to try and get the layout to match it. If I could do one thing differently I would set up started html earlier. Having a normal usual format that I could load up when I started a project was really time saving and convenient. After that I would try to take some design or creative lessons to help me in that department.</p>
  <p>For my feedback I asked my cousin Mark who’s very used to technology. His suggestions were to add a slideshow of some sort and a few design / discrepancies I had. I’ll cover those first. On my table in the history tab one of the entries wasn’t capitalized like the others, so that was a simple fix. One of my titles on the form wasn’t labeled so I went to Wufoo and quickly solved that. After that he noticed that my contact on the footer wasn’t linked to the actual page so I had to go to each page and change that to hyperlinks, then change the style back to normal. Next the footer on two of the pages wasn’t at the bottom b/c of how short they were. This one was really hard to fix. I tried a bunch of things from position and min-length to try to get it to work, but none of them did. They would either oddly take it out of the flow of the pages or just flat out not work. I also faced trouble with using % for heights. For some reason it wouldn’t change the page at all, which was weird. I eventually went to each page and used margin bottoms to manually push the footer down to a seemingly normal level because I was running out of time. For the slide show it mostly functioned the same as in our cycle lab. I had to actually go in and resize each of the images this time though. It wasn’t that hard using gravit. After that I used a display: left to format some text around it and then setting the height to make the next items not intrude.</p>
